A uniform sampling method is implemented for the discretization of the Onsager model, and solution landscapes of the Onsager model are constructed using saddle dynamics coupled with downward/upward search algorithms. We first construct the solution landscapes with the dipolar and Maier–Saupe potentials, for which all critical points are axisymmetric. For the coupled dipolar/Maier–Saupe potential, the solution landscape shows a novel non-axisymmetric critical point, named tennis, which exists for a wide range of parameters. We further demonstrate various nonaxisymmetric critical points in the Onsager model with the Onsager potential, including square, hexagon, octahedral, cubic, quarter, icosahedral, and dodecahedral states. The bifurcation diagram is presented to show the primary and secondary bifurcations of the isotropic state and reveal the emergence of the critical points. The solution landscape provides an efficient approach to show the global structure of the model system as well as the bifurcations of critical points, which can not only support the previous theoretical conjectures but also propose new conjectures based on the numerical findings.","tags":null,"title":"Solution Landscape of the Onsager Model Identifies Non-axisymmetric Critical Points","type":"publication"},{"authors":["王娟","张一","黄晶","李由君","宋洁","张平文"],"categories":["digiteco"],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"acbfdb2889b111ee1c1b37b585d18cee","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2022_zgszstzsdcsyfx/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2022_zgszstzsdcsyfx/","section":"publication","summary":"数字时代悄然来临，数字中国建设成为国家战略，营造良好的数字生态，是建设数字中国的内在要求。基于数字经 济、数字社会和数字政府等相关内涵及发展态势的研究，从数字基础、数字能力、数字应用三个维度，构建衡量区域 数字生态发展的测量体系，并创新性地应用大数据分析方法，依托全国领域内代表性机构海量数据研制的分项指数， 运用熵值法综合测算2020年中国数字生态指数。通过全面、深度刻画中国省级和城市级不同地区数字生态的发展水 平、驱动模式、区域格局、发展韧性等基本情况，为各地发展数字生态、落地数字中国战略提供决策支持。","tags":null,"title":"中国数字生态指数的测算与分析","type":"publication"},{"authors":["王娟","张蕴洁","宋洁","张平文"],"categories":["digiteco"],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"626ee297ec2fc0f9bde1c51aed4c3530","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2022_zmoszjjymydbjyj/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2022_zmoszjjymydbjyj/","section":"publication","summary":"发展数字经济和扩大数字贸易是中国抢占全球发展制高点、构建“双循环”新发展 格局的内在要求。明确中国在国际竞争格局中的位置，特别是厘清中国相对于美国和欧盟的 优势与劣势，对于研判中国数字经济的“双循环”发展趋势至关重要。在梳理数字经济与贸 易的概念内涵及测算方法的基础上，通过对国内外权威数据进行多重比较分析，从规模格局、 结构格局、动态格局、竞争格局以及依赖格局等方面进行深入研究，发现中国数字经济与贸 易处于“大而不优、快而不先、盈而不赢”的状态。据此提出全面优化数字经济结构、在电 子设备制造业扬长避短、在信息服务业培育新势、在数字媒体业扭转劣势等对策建议。","tags":null,"title":"中美欧数字经济与贸易的比较研究","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wei Wang","Lei Zhang","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"975d35ab7c7dd4535784dec587287b19","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2021_mclc/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2021_mclc/","section":"publication","summary":"Liquid crystal is a typical kind of soft matter that is intermediate between crystalline solids and isotropic fluids.

During weather consultation, the forecasters obtain the final results by combining the observations with the NWP results and giving opinions based on their experience. It is obvious that using a suitable post-processing algorithm for simulating weather consultation is an interesting and important topic. MOML is a post-processing method based on machine learning, which matches NWP forecasts against observations through a regression function. By adopting different feature engineering of datasets and training periods, the observational and model data can be processed into the corresponding training set and test set. The MOML regression function uses an existing machine learning algorithm with the processed dataset to revise the output of NWP models combined with the observations, so as to improve the results of weather forecasts. To test the new approach for grid temperature forecasts, the 2-m surface air temperature in the Beijing area from the ECMWF model is used. MOML with different feature engineering is compared against the ECMWF model and modified model output statistics (MOS) method. MOML shows a better numerical performance than the ECMWF model and MOS, especially for winter. The results of MOML with a linear algorithm, running training period, and dataset using spatial interpolation ideas, are better than others when the forecast time is within a few days. The results of MOML with the Random Forest algorithm, year-round training period, and dataset containing surrounding gridpoint information, are better when the forecast time is longer.","tags":null,"title":"A Model Output Machine Learning Method for Grid Temperature Forecasts in the Beijing Area","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tian Tian","Han Wang","Wei Ge","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1ad00ada1a22ff5f9d7b2bd99567e1f","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2019_dpcpsdbm/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2019_dpcpsdbm/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) method is proposed to detect particle clusters in particle-fluid systems.

Most of the studies focused on the elastic properties of fluid membranes, despite the ubiquitous presence of membranes with liquid-crystalline order. Here the elastic properties of liquidcrystalline bilayers self-assembled from diblock copolymers composed of a semiflexible block are studied theoretically. Specifically, the self-consistent field theory (SCFT) is applied to a model system composed of semiflexible–flexible diblock copolymers dissolved in flexible homopolymers that act as solvents. The free energy of self-assembled tensionless bilayer membranes in three different geometries, i.e. planar, cylindrical and spherical, is obtained by solving the SCFT equations using a hybrid method, in which the orientation-dependent functions are treated using the spherical harmonics, whereas the position-dependent operators are treated using the compact difference schemes. The bending modulus kM and Gaussian modulus kG of the bilayer are extracted from the free energies. The effects of the molecular parameters of the system, such as the chain rigidity and the orientational interaction, are systematically examined.","tags":null,"title":"Elastic properties of liquid-crystalline bilayers self-assembled from semiflexible-flexible deblock copolymers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianyuan Yin","Lei Zhang","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"5b34021fa84fe200b23f06aae5c34ebf","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2019_hosdmfhsp/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2019_hosdmfhsp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"High-index Optimization-based Shrinking Dimer Method for Finding High-Index Saddle Points","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7de37d43a1d71c571af88db79c20393e","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/students/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/students/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c47153ce37fc454158e5fe9a9fda9253","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/test/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/test/","section":"","summary":"Hello!","tags":null,"title":"Landing Page","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Yucen Han","Yucheng Hu","Pingwen Zhang","Lei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2f0b2b474eee3460625b1947d2734aad","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2019_tpbdpcnlc/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2019_tpbdpcnlc/","section":"publication","summary":"Confined nematic liquid crystals can admit multiple stable equilibria. These equilibrium states usually exhibit peculiar defect patterns in order to satisfy the topological constraints imposed by the boundary conditions. In this work, we systematically investigate transition pathways between different stable equilibria of nematic liquid crystals confined in a cylinder with homeotropic boundary condition. To do so, we implement spectral method to minimize the Landau-de Gennes free energy and develop a multiscale string method to accurately compute both minimal energy path and transition state. We first compute the transition pathways under the assumption that system state is invariant along the axial direction of the cylinder. This axial invariant assumption allows us to reduce the simulation domain to a two-dimensional disk. We subsequently remove the axial invariant assumption to search the transition pathways in the three-dimensional cylinder. Numerical simulations demonstrate that there exists a threshold for the cylinder height above which a dominolike transition pathway is more energetically favored than the axial invariant transition pathway. Moreover, we show that the transition pathway from escape radial with ring defects (ERRD) to escape radial has a lower energy barrier than the one from ERRD to planar polar, even though the free energy of the planar polar state is lower than that of the escape radial state. Our approach provides an accurate and efficient method to compute minimal energy path and transition state of confined nematic liquid crystals.","tags":null,"title":"Transition pathways between defect patterns in confined nematic liquid crystals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yixiang Luo","Jie Xu","Pingwen Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"1175398f62276c0726a058a9ee9c74b9","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2018_fambd/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2018_fambd/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a fast algorithm for evaluating the moments of Bingham distribution.

A large range of the spherical size is covered in this study, corresponding to a 5CB-liquid-crystal comparison for assembling micron- to nano-sized colloidal spheres. Multiple configurations are found for each given particle size and the most stable state is determined by a comparison of the free energies. From large to small colloidal particles, a sequence of structures, which range from quasi-one-dimensional (columnar), to quasi-two-dimensional (planar), and to truly three-dimensional, are found to exist.","tags":null,"title":"Formation of three-dimensional colloidal crystals in a nematic liquid crystal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiajie Chen","Pingwen Zhang","Zhifei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"345c9c20c85b860b9371986f613d18f2","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2018_lmdgtciip/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2018_lmdgtciip/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we investigate the structure of local minimizers for the isotropic–nematic interface based on the Landau-de Gennes energy.

Two typical strong anchoring boundary conditions, namely homeotropic and mirror-homeotropic anchoring conditions, are considered. For the homeotropic anchoring, we find three different configurations: uniaxial hedgehog, ring and split-core, in both cases with or without the anisotropic energy. For the mirror-homeotropic anchoring, there are also three analogue solutions: the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog, ring and split-core for the isotropic energy case. However, when the anisotropic energy is taken into account, the numerical results and rigorous analysis reveal that the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog is no longer a solution. Indeed, we find ring solution only for negative L2 (the elastic coefficient of the anisotropic energy), while both split-core and ring solutions can be stable minimizers for positive L2. More precisely, the uniaxial hyperbolic hedgehog for L2 = 0 bifurcates to a split-core solution when L2 increases and to a ring solution when L2 decreases. This example shows that the anisotropic energy may significantly affect the symmetry of point defects with degree −1 whenever it is introduced.","tags":null,"title":"On equilibrium configurations of nematic liquid crystals droplet with anisotropic elastic energy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinhae Park","Wei Wang","Pingwen Zhang","Zhifei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"98871c301a7f45cc2a4866803592fbf5","permalink":"https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/pzhang/en/publication/2017_miip/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/pzhang/en/publication/2017_miip/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper, we investigate the structure and stability of the isotropic-nematic interface in 1-D.

Recently the study of defects has drawn a lot of attention because of the growing theoretical and practical significance. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects within nematic liquid crystals confined in a shell. A highly accurate spectral method is used to solve the Landau-de Gennes model to get the detailed static structures of defects. Interestingly, the solution is radial-invariant when the thickness of the shell is sufficiently small. As the shell thickness increases, the solution undergoes symmetry break to reconfigure the disclination lines. We study this three-dimensional reconfiguration of disclination lines in detail under different boundary conditions. In particular, we find that the temperature plays an important role in deciding whether the transition between two-dimensional defects and three-dimensional defects is continuous or discontinuous for the shell with planar anchoring condition on both inner and outer surfaces.

We implement a spectral method that numerically solves the Landau-de Gennes model with high accuracy, which allows us to study the detailed static structure of defects. We observe five types of defect structures. Among them the 1/2-disclination lines are the most stable structure at low temperature. Inspired by numerical results, we obtain the profile of disclination lines analytically. Moreover, the connection and difference between defect patterns under the Landau-de Gennes model and the Oseen-Frank model are discussed.
